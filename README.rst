A thimble is a tool for playing with needle and thread safely. This
library, thimble, wraps objects that have a blocking API with a
non-blocking, Twisted-friendly Deferred API by means of thread pools.

Quick start
===========

The main object you're interested in is ``thimble.Thimble``. It takes a
thread pool, a blocking object, and a list of method names that you
would like to defer to the thread pool.

Here's our example blocking object:

>>> class Car(object):
...     wheels = 4
...     def drive_to(self, location):
...          # Assume the real implementation blocks.
...          return "driven to {0}".format(location)
>>> car = Car()

For demonstration purposes, we'll use a test doubles for the thread
pool and reactor; in real code, you'll want to use the real thing.

>>> from thimble.test.util import FakeThreadPool, FakeReactor
>>> pool = FakeThreadPool()
>>> reactor = FakeReactor()

The pool hasn't been started yet. (We'll see why that matters in a
minute.)

>>> pool.started
False

Create a ``Thimble``:

>>> from thimble import Thimble
>>> car_thimble = Thimble(reactor, pool, car, ["drive_to"])

When accessing a method named in the list, you get an object wrapping
it instead. Calling it returns a Deferred. Any arguments passed are
passed verbatim to the wrapped method.

>>> def print_(s):
...     # can't use from __future__ import print_function because of a
...     # doctest limitation :-(
...     print s

>>> d = car_thimble.drive_to("work").addCallback(print_)
driven to work

This Deferred has already fired synchronously, because we're using a
fake thread pool and reactor.

You can access other attributes of the wrapped object directly on the
``Thimble``:

>>> car.wheels
4

If the thread pool that you pass to a ``Thimble`` hasn't been started
yet when it first tries to use it, the ``Thimble`` will start it and
schedule its shutdown. If you pass a thread pool that *was* already
started, you are responsible for its shutdown. In this case, the
thread pool was not started yet, so ``Thimble`` started it for you:

>>> pool.started
True

Shut down the reactor, and the reactor will ask the thread pool to
stop right before shutting down itself.

>>> reactor.stop()
>>> pool.started
False

Using thimble in your code
--------------------------

Thread pools
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can choose to use the reactor thread pool, or create your own
thread pool.

Using the reactor thread pool is potentially a bad idea. The reactor
thread pool is shared between a lot of software by default, and is
also used for DNS resolution. If your software blocks all the
available threads in the pool (either by accident or because of a
bug), that affects DNS resolution, which in turn can affect many other
systems; if it doesn't affect those systems directly (because they,
too, want to use the reactor thread pool).

It's probably most reliable to have a dedicated thread pool per
application, for two reasons:

- The application probably knows best what a good size would be for
  the thread pool.
- It is an appropriate state to put the global state: if you were to
  put it in a library, different users of the library in the same
  process can end up tripping over each other.

Unfortunately, shared global state is pretty much how you do it::

  from twisted.python.threadpool import ThreadPool
  _the_thread_pool = _ThreadPool()

See the documentation for the ThreadPool class for more details; it
allows you to specify a minimum and maximum number of threads. The
default values are probably pretty reasonable.

Concurrency and thread safety
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The number of threads you specify your thread pool to have is the
number of threads that can try to access your object concurrently.
it's up to you to make sure that the object is actually thread safe.

If you would like to provide a non-blocking API to an object that
isn't thread safe, you can just limit the number of threads in the
thread pool to 1, causing fully synchronized access. Keep in mind that
attribute accesses for any attribute name that isn't in the
``blocking_methods`` list will still be performed synchronously by the
calling thread.

Entry points
~~~~~~~~~~~~

While subclassing ``Thimble`` may accidentally work, it is not
recommended. I reserve the right to change the implementation in a way
that might break that: for example, by introducing a metaclass.

It's probably better to write a small utility function that either
constructs a new ``Thimble`` that uses a shared thread pool, or always
returns the same thimble.

Attribute hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes, it isn't good enough to simply call a method in a thread
somewhere. You may need to modify the arguments before calling the
underlying method, too. For example, if the underlying method takes a
callback function, it may be called in some other thread, but if the
callback function expects to be able to interact with the reactor, it
has to be called in the reactor thread. For example:

>>> class FancyCar(Car):
...     def __init__(self):
...         self.alarm_callback = None
...     def register_alarm_callback(self, callback):
...         self.alarm_callback = callback
...     def alarm(self):
...         print " WOO ".join(["WEE"] * 5)
...         if self.alarm_callback is not None:
...             self.alarm_callback()
>>> def alarm_callback():
...     # This uses Twisted to talk to the SMS service, so it
...     # needs to be called in the reactor thread.
...     print "sending sms... hopefully I am in the reactor thread!"

To do this, define an attribute hook function. That's a function that
takes the thimble instance, the attribute name being looked up, and
its current value; then returns its replacement value.

>>> from functools import partial, wraps
>>> from inspect import getcallargs
>>> def hook(thimble, attr, val):
...     @wraps(val)
...     def run_callback_in_reactor_thread_wrapper(*a, **kw):
...         callargs = getcallargs(val, *a, **kw)
...         orig_callback = callargs["callback"]
...         def wrapped_callback():
...             print "calling original callback in reactor thread"
...             thimble._reactor.callFromThread(orig_callback)
...         callargs["callback"] = wrapped_callback
...         return val(callback=wrapped_callback)
...     return run_callback_in_reactor_thread_wrapper

While all of this ``getcallargs`` trickery makes little sense when
you know that there's only one such callback and it doesn't take any
arguments, it's included here in the documentation because it's:

- particularly useful when you have a wide array of methods with
  slightly different signatures, but which all have a callback method
  that needs to be wrapped like the above one (a reasonably common
  case),
- fairly unknown.

Set up the thimble:

>>> fancy_car = FancyCar()
>>> fancy_car_thimble = Thimble(reactor, pool, fancy_car,
...     ["drive_to"], {"register_alarm_callback": hook})

Now, when we access that method, we get the wrapper:

>>> fancy_car_thimble.register_alarm_callback(alarm_callback)
>>> fancy_car_thimble.alarm()
WEE WOO WEE WOO WEE WOO WEE WOO WEE
calling original callback in reactor thread
sending sms... hopefully I am in the reactor thread!

You can also use hooks for methods that are asynchronified. The
attribute hook is evaluated *before* the method is made asynchronous.
